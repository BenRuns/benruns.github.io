- Founding members at the first  meeting at [C & P Coffee](http://candpcoffee.com/) Justin D. not pictured


It's been several months since we had our first meeting at C & P.  That meeting came about from several CoffeeOps members having a conversation about linux learning resources. The possibility of forming a group was proposed and since many of the much of the group lived in West Seattle, didn't want to cross the bridge on the weekend, and a member had already bought a domain name and acquired a twitter handle, the West Seattle Linux Users Group (WSeaLUG) was born!

We've since started meeting at the [Fauntleroy YMCA](https://www.seattleymca.org/locations/west-seattle-fauntleroy-ymca) to make space for our growing community.  We've had donuts and coffee, good conversation about Ham radio, and our members have given a series of truly excellent presentations.
