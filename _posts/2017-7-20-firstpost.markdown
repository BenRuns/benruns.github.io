Life happens and you just need to keep pushing through. It's been a big year for me.
Had a few setbacks. Had some good things happen. The last few months have been tough 
dealing with some health issues while looking for work and also finding a new place to live.

I'm gratefull for the support of family and friends and gratefull that the worst of
it happened while the sun was out in Seattle. I'm not sure I would have been able to
avoid falling into some deep depression if the same events occured in the dead of winter.
There's a lot more that I could be writing about here, but it doesn't feel appropriate to 
go to deep into what's been going on in my life in the first post.

I've managed to keep my head above water in the job search. I've had interviews and enough 
callbacks that I'm not discouraged. Either I'll find the right team or the right team will 
find me any day now. I hate to say it but the job search feels more like dating than anything 
else. Everyone's got advice, decisions are made on instinct and emotion as much as they are by cold
calculation and sometime's you're deemed below a potential partner's notice without the right 
set of attributes. Dating and job searching are easier for some than others.

It's been a while since I've been dating but I assume the strategy is about the same.
Make a good online profile. Go to where people are and talk to them. Don't be a jerk.
Maintain excellent hygeine. Do something impressive. Show some ambition. 

Right now, I'm working on making a good online profile and showing some ambition. The aforementioned
setbacks sort of knocked the wind out of me and I haven't kept up with side projects the 
way that I wanted to. My personal site is half started and it's been months since
I've even read through the open source projects that I wanted to contribute to when I suddenly 
found myself with some free time.  To start, I want to get at least one github contribution
per day. I figure if I start a jekyll blog, I can always just throw together an entry
if I don't have anything I want to commit. It's cheating but I'm also trying to keep it 
simple so I can save mental energy for the job search and studying and aquiring skils to 
aid in said search.

All the Best,

Ben
